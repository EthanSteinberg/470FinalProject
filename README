This is my final project for BIOC 470.

Note that this requires my C++ probability computing library, networkprob to be compiled before use.

You can find the code for that library in the networkprob folder.

codeBeforeProject.zip holds the code for networkprob before this project.
(I added the feature to compute the derivative for a network as part of this project).

Also, some of the scripts for processing the mouse data require the mouse data seperately as well as phylib to be installed.

simpleFakeExperiment.m runs the synthetic experiments.
solveMigrationSample.m recomputes the migration sample assuming you already have it processed from computeWeightsFromData.
